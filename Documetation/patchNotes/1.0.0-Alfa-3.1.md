# 1.0.0-Alfa-3.1.md - PR:[6](https://github.com/Sklenik/TextRPG/pull/6)
Date : 26. 4. 2024
 - fixed a bug that caused the game to crash when an item was eaten (consumable healvalues were defined as strings that on assignment overwritten the default integers in the item class, causing item.healvalue to return strings which crashed when a message that expected integer got the string instead)
 - PR 4 was used to remove resolved TODOs
 - PR 5 was used to update overview.md (missing version)
