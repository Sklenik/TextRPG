# TODO create jsonParser to simplify JSON file creation? (a program to create JSON files out of simple .txt, I think it might help with creating different creatures, items, etc.)

#FIXME if backack is full, and item can be added (count can be increased) backpackfull funciton still occurs
#FIXME magic fail occurs twice (whic means it does double damage = BAD)
